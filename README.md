This mod will add a new decoration block variant,
called shutters to enhance your windows.


The block is a mix between trapdoor and door,
when placed, the shutter will only be one block in size,Â 
however you can place blocks underneath or above
and they will connect!


Shutters have three states:
closed, half opened and fully opened.
If there are blocks beside the shutter,
they only open halfway.


This Mod supports several mods like Supplementaries, Quark, Ecologics and Create
Other Mods are: Environmental, Upgrade Aquatic, Snowy Spirit, Autumnity, Oreganized, GoodEnding
This mod is supported by Every Compat.
